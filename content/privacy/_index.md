# devjob.plan Privacy Policy
**Effective Date: December 24, 2025**

A journal is a personal thing.  For that reason, **devjob.plan** (DJP) and RealProven, LLC treat your privacy as an essential feature of this experience.  The specifics are as follows:

### Data We Collect
- **Journal Notes and Document Content**  
  All journal entries, notes, and document data are stored exclusively on your device (and in iCloud if you enable it for your own syncing/backup). We never access, transmit, or store this data on our servers.

- **Search and Browsing Interactions**  
  **DJP** monitors browsing within the integrated web view (e.g., URLs visited, page titles, extracted job-related elements) solely to help you add relevant content to your personal journal.  This data is used only locally to support journaling features and is not transmitted, stored long-term, or shared in any way.

- **No Other Data Collection**  
  We do not collect analytics, usage data, crash reports, or any other information about how you use the app.

### Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or transmit any of your data to third parties, except as required by law.

### Data Security
Your journal data is protected by macOS file system security and, when using iCloud, Apple's encryption standards.

### Your Rights
You control all your data. You can view, edit, export, or delete your journals at any time. Uninstalling the app removes all local data.

### Changes to This Policy
We will update this policy if our practices change and notify you via the app or website.

If you have any specific questions about this policy that aren’t answered here, please feel free to [contact us](../support).
